# basic_login_page_using_html_and_css

I have created a basic login page using html and css and I will try to improve the login page in the process of my learning.

I have created a login_form.html file which contains the basic actions and how I link to css file(style.css) , forgot_password.html and  dont_have_an_account.html. These files are linked to login_form.html.
